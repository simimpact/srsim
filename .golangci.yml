  ## golangci defaults
  # - errcheck # checking for unchecked errors, these unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases
  - gosimple # specializes in simplifying a code
  - govet # reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string
  - ineffassign # detects when assignments to existing variables are not used
  - staticcheck # is a go vet on steroids, applying a ton of static analysis checks
  - typecheck # like the front-end of a Go compiler, parses and type-checks Go code
  
  ## style & formatting
  - gofmt # go fmt requirement
  - goimports # in addition to fixing imports, goimports also formats your code in the same style as gofmt
  - stylecheck # style check rules defined by staticcheck (minimum go standard style)
  - gocritic # provides diagnostics that check for bugs, performance and style issues
  - whitespace # detects leading and trailing whitespace
  # - revive # fast, configurable, extensible, flexible, and beautiful linter for Go, drop-in replacement of golint

  ## code complexity detectors
  # - cyclop # checks function and package cyclomatic complexity
  # - exhaustive # checks exhaustiveness of enum switch statements
  # - funlen # tool for detection of long functions
  # - lll # reports long lines
  # - gocognit # computes and checks the cognitive complexity of functions
  # - gocyclo # computes and checks the cyclomatic complexity of functions

  ## additional highly recommended linters to catch codesmell & bugs
  - unused # checks for unused constants, variables, functions and types
  - asasalint # checks for pass []any as any in variadic func(...any)
  - bidichk # checks for dangerous unicode character sequences
  - dogsled # checks assignments with too many blank identifiers (e.g. x, , , _, := f())
  # - dupl # tool for code clone detection
  - errchkjson # checks for unnecessary json marshal error checks
  - errname # checks that sentinel errors are prefixed with the Err and error types are suffixed with the Error
  - errorlint # finds code that will cause problems with the error wrapping scheme introduced in Go 1.13
  - exportloopref # checks for pointers to enclosing loop variables
  - gocheckcompilerdirectives # validates go compiler directive comments (//go:)
  - goconst # finds repeated strings that could be replaced by a constant
  - gomodguard # allow and block lists linter for direct Go module dependencies. This is different from depguard where there are different block types for example version constraints and module recommendations
  - goprintffuncname # checks that printf-like functions are named with f at the end
  - makezero # finds slice declarations with non-zero initial length
  - mirror # reports wrong mirror patterns of bytes/strings usage
  # - musttag # enforces field tags in (un)marshaled structs
  - nakedret # finds naked returns in functions greater than a specified function length
  # - nestif # reports deeply nested if statements
  - nilerr # finds the code that returns nil even if it checks that the error is not nil
  # - nilnil # checks that there is no simultaneous return of nil error and an invalid value
  - nolintlint # reports ill-formed or insufficient nolint directives
  - nonamedreturns # reports all named returns
  - predeclared # finds code that shadows one of Go's predeclared identifiers
  - reassign # checks that package variables are not reassigned
  - tenv # detects using os.Setenv instead of t.Setenv since Go1.17
  - testableexamples # checks if examples are testable (have an expected output)
  - tparallel # detects inappropriate usage of t.Parallel() method in your Go test codes
  - unconvert # removes unnecessary type conversions
  - unparam # reports unused function parameters
  - usestdlibvars # detects the possibility to use variables/constants from the Go standard library
  - wastedassign # finds wasted assignment statements

  # - exhaustruct # [highly recommend to enable] checks if all structure fields are initialized
